Overall Project:
I will be making a fan with different speeds from 0 to 5. The user can select any
speed of their choosing with 0 being off and 5 being the fastest. It will have a
shortcut for off and on

Components:
1. Joystick
2. 4-Digit 7-Segment Display
3. Fan Blade + 3-6V Motor

Component Description:
The user can choose the speeds by moving the joystick from left to right. Left will
go to 0 and right will go to 5 (0 - OFF, 1 - VERY LOW, 2 - LOW, 3 - MEDIUM, 4 -
HIGH, 5 - VERY HIGH). If you move the joystick up, it will immediately set the
speed to HIGH (4); if you move the joystick down, it will immediately set the
speed to OFF (0)
